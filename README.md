Introduction

Welcome to the beginning of my journey through the Odin Project. This README provides an overview of the structure and components used to organize recipes on our website.

Folders/Files
- recipes: This directory contains HTML files named descriptively, each representing a different recipe.
- images: This directory contains image files named descriptively, corresponding to the recipes.
- index.html: This is the homepage of the website.

Structure

The website is structured using HTML.

Main Content Area:
- Contains a comprehensive list of all recipes.
- Recipes are organized into sections using unordered lists.
- Each recipe is represented as a list item with hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to specific recipes.

Footer
- Credits the Allrecipes website for the sourced recipes.

Future Development

This project is continuously being developed. Your suggestions and contributions are highly appreciated to enhance the website further.
